## Model planing
We are going to use Neural networks to solve a binary text classification problem, there are may alternatives that belongs to, for example Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

In this case we are going to explore basic Neural Networks with Keras for text classification.
